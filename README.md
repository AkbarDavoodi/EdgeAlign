EdgeAlign

EdgeAlign is a Python tool for aligning multiple E-graphs (edge-centric graph representations) based on the framework presented in:
Akbar Davoodi, Christoph Flamm, Daniel Merkle, and Peter F Stadler, "Edgeâ€‘wise Graph Alignments", Submitted.
This repository provides a working implementation of progressive E-graph alignments using a VF2-inspired backtracking approach. The method computes pairwise alignments and then combines them into a composite multiple alignment. This approach is particularly useful in applications such as cheminformatics.
